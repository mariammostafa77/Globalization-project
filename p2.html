                    What is 'Globalization'?
                    Globalization represents the global integration of international trade, investment, information technology and cultures.
                    Government policies designed to open economies domestically and internationally to boost development in poorer countries
                    and raise standards of living for their people are what drive globalization. However, these policies have created an
                    international free market that has mainly benefited multinational corporations in the Western world to the detriment of
                    smaller businesses, cultures and common people. 
                    Etymology and usage
                    The term globalization derives from the word globalize, which refers to the emergence of an international network of
                    economic systems.One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled Towards
                    new Education, where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.The term 'globalization' had been
                    used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944. Theodore
                    Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of
                    the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its
                    antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and empire across Asia and the Indian Ocean from the 15th century onward
                    Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a
                    single aspect of globalization .Sociologists Martin Albrow and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes
                    by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society." In The Consequences of Modernity, 
                    Anthony Giddens writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide social relations which link 
                    distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa.
                     In 1992, Roland Robertson, professor of sociology at the University of Aberdeen and an early writer in the field, described
                      globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole.
                     extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.
