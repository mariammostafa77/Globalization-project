                Definition of Globalisation The process of increased integration and co-operation of different national economies. It involves national economies becoming increasingly inter-related and integrated.

Globalisation has involved:

Greater free trade.
Greater movement of labour.
Increased capital flows.
The growth of multi-national companies.
Increased integration of global trade cycle.
Increased communication and improved transport, effectively reducing barriers between countries.
Benefits of globalisation
1. Free trade Free trade is a way for countries to exchange goods and resources. This means countries can specialise in producing goods where they have a comparative advantage (this means they can produce goods at a lower opportunity cost). When countries specialise there will be several gains from trade:

Lower prices for consumers
Greater choice of goods, e.g food imports enable a more extensive diet.
Bigger export markets for domestic manufacturers
Economies of scale through being able to specialise in certain goods
Greater competition
See: Benefits of Free Trade


2. Free movement of labour

Increased labour migration gives advantages to both workers and recipient countries. If a country experiences high unemployment, there are increased opportunities to look for work elsewhere. This process of labour migration also helps reduce geographical inequality. This has been quite effective in the EU, with many Eastern European workers migrating west.

Also, it helps countries with labour shortages fill important posts. For example, the UK needed to recruit nurses from the far east to fill shortages.

However, this issue is also quite controversial. Some are concerned that free movement of labour can cause excess pressure on housing and social services in some countries. Countries like the US have responded to this process by actively trying to prevent migrants from other countries.

3. Increased economies of scale

Production is increasingly specialised. Globalisation enables goods to be produced in different parts of the world. This greater specialisation enables lower average costs and lower prices for consumers.

4. Greater competition

Domestic monopolies used to be protected by a lack of competition. However, globalisation means that firms face greater competition from foreign firms.

5. Increased investment

Globalisation has also enabled increased levels of investment. It has made it easier for countries to attract short-term and long-term investment. Investment by multinational companies can play a big role in improving the economies of developing countries.
