                         Globalization or globalisation is the process of interaction and integration between people, companies, and governments worldwide.
                         Globalization has grown due to advances in transportation and communication technology. With increased global interactions comes 
                         the growth of international trade, ideas, and culture. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration
                         that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, conflicts and diplomacy are also large parts of the history of 
                         globalization, and modern globalization.Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital,
                         technology, and data.The steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, and container ships are some of the advances in the means of
                         transport while the rise of the telegraph and its modern offspring, the Internet and mobile phones show development in telecommunications
                         infrastructure. All of these improvements have been major factors in globalization and have generated further interdependence of economic
                         and cultural activities around the globe.Though many scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history long before the European Age
                         of Discovery and voyages to the New World, some even to the third millennium BC. Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s.In the late 19th century and early 20th
                         century, the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly.

               <h3>Economic globalization</h3>
               <p>
                    Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase
                    in cross-border movement of goods, services, technology, and capital. Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the
                    diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic 
                    globalization is the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or
                    a single world market.

               <h3>Cultural globalization</h3>
               <p>
                    Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify
                    social relations.This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, popular culture media,
                    and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural
                    meaning around the globe.
